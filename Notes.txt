Notice:
    - replaced policy and value in net eval return. remember to switch back when testing my model

Issues:
    - dont use softmax to train policy
    - use model.train() from torch to put batchnorm into affect
    - train batch/more epochs

ideas:    
    - revert to net output relative to curr player and not static(or allow both)

Add:
    - Tests
    - GUI (pygame)
