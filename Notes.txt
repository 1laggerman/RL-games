Notice:
    - replaced policy and value in net eval return for testing. remember to switch back

Issues:
    - dont use softmax to train policy
    - use model.train() from torch to put batchnorm into affect
    - train batch/more epochs
    - create nodes without evaluating
    - 

ideas:    
    - revert to net output relative to curr player and not static(or allow both)

Add:
    - Tests
    - GUI (pygame)
    - move reward attached to Role
